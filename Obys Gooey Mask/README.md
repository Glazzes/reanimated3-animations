## Obys Agency Gooey Mask

### About
I've found myself mesmerized by the beatiful hover effect on [obys's agency](https://obys.agency/) website, my first instict when I see the gooey mask was "At first glance this is some sort of noise" I wasn't wrong, this cool animation takes heavy inpiration from [this awesome article](https://vishald.com/blog/gooey-webgl/#antialiasing) on creating gooey meatballs in GLSL.
