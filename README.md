### About
I'm someone driven by curiosity, all of the contents of this repository have been achieved with the greatest tool ever given to us by nature, observation.

This repository is a compilation of my most study sessions, not only to prove myself and others what I'm capable of but to prove animations **can be done** by anyone.

Animations are in itself are very intimidating task, but I myself just like you were pretty bad at this kind of visual stuff once.

You can get good overtime with enough practice, so do not give up easily.

### Animations
>[!Note]
> I don't have access to apple devices, therefore all animations have been created with an Android device, consider opening a pull request if you feel like something is off.

Each animation is a stand alone Expo managed application or a custom development client in case of requiring native libraries.

All animations contain a short description, notes and video footage.
