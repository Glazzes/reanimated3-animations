### About

I'm someone driven by curiosity, all of the contents of this repository have been achieved with the greatest
tool ever given to us by nature, observation. This repository is a compilation of my most study sessions,
not only to prove myself and others what I'm capable of but to prove complex and visually engaging user interfaces
**can be done** by anyone. Animations are in itself are very intimidating task, but I myself just like you
were pretty bad at this kind of visual stuff once.

You can get good overtime with enough practice, so do not give up easily.

### Animations

> [!Note]
> I don't have access to apple devices, therefore all animations have been created with an Android device,
> consider opening a pull request if you feel like something is off.

Each animation is a stand alone Expo managed application or a custom development client in case of requiring
native libraries.

All animations contain a short description, notes and video footage.

These ones are not animations, however its contents can complement the creation of some animations or in
